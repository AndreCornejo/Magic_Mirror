# Magic_Mirror

We will be building a smart mirror utilizing the raspberry pi that can give the user a welcome message, display the current date and time, forecast for the day, and make video calls to friends and family through Skype using a camera. The smart display will turn on when the user walks in front of the mirror, using a motion detection sensor.
